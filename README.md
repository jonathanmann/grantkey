# GrantKey

## Overview
GrantKey is software that allows any guarantor to issue reputation-backed digital credit grants which can be used by anyone willing to accepting them. If multiple parties trust a the guarantor, but not each other, this software will allow the guarantor to function as a clearinghouse by which credit backed by the guarantor can be transferred from one party to another. 

## Roadmap
